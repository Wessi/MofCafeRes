Start with essential attributes and add more later based on specific needs.
Keep data normalized for efficient querying and reporting.
Use clear and consistent naming conventions for attributes.
By following these principles and focusing on a flexible data structure, you can build a cafeteria management system that provides valuable insights for informed decision-making.
